      "Heyyyy! I'm Doris, a 25 year old young professional living in Melbourne. I love cooking and always love to share homemade food with friends. I also enjoy doing some reading during weekends while having sunbath in our huge backyard. Would love to share my story with you and meet new people here!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
